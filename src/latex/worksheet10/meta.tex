\section{General Comments}
\begin{questions}
\item Focus on
\begin{itemize}
\item LLSE: all parts
\item Covariance: 2.1 and 2.2.1
\item Conditional Expectation: all parts
\end{itemize}
\item Covariance: Make the connection between the covariance formula and the variance formula, and why it makes sense to define covariance this way.
\item LLSE
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure to do covariance and conditional expectation first because LLSE relies on it
\item Explain what LLSE is, and why the formula makes sense--intuitively, why. If there is time or interest, prove it.
\end{itemize}

\item Conditional Expectation
\begin{itemize}
\item Make the connection between normal expectation and conditional expectation, and explain intuitively what conditional expectation means
\item Explain what LLSE is, and why the formula makes sense--intuitively, why. If there is time or interest, prove it.
\end{itemize}
\item Markov Chains
\begin{itemize}
\item First order Markov property: probability of an object being in any state depends only on the state the object was in right before
\item Homogeneity: Regardless of how many steps the chain has run, the transition matrix doesnâ€™t change (i.e. $P(X_{i+1} = a | X_{i} = b$) is the same regardless of the value of $i$)
\item Irreducibility: there is no sink
\item A state x is periodic if by starting in x, all ways of returning to x have some GCD greater than 1. If any state is periodic, then the chain is periodic.
\item Explain the intuition behind stationary/invariant distributions and irreducibility and aperiodicity
\end{itemize}

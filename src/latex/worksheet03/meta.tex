Ask them about the guerilla session, if they attended; what they thought about it – what they liked/didn’t like, etc.
And also same thing about our review session slides
Bijections
Make sure they understand one-to-one/onto/injective/surjective
The “why is this mapping (not) bijective” questions are important
Make sure they’re comfortable with bijections (this will be especially important in RSA)
FLT
Last question is kind of repetitive – skip if low on time
RSA
Sections earlier in the week may not have strong RSA practice, so don’t spend too much time if they aren’t very familiar with it
If you don’t get to the RSA questions, briefly explain how it works on a high-level
Make sure they understand how RSA actually works – the implementation questions test for that pretty well
Draw a picture! Ask what is public? What is private?
Coin tosses question is interesting. Tests if they actually understand why RSA works, rather than just how it’s implemented
Go over the proof from notes on how/why RSA works
CRT
THIS SECTION WAS REMOVED. NOT COVERED THIS SEMESTER
Polynomials
Monday-Wednesday will probably not get to this
Secret Sharing
This is in there just for Friday people
Mandatory questions you have to get to
Bijections: 
Why you can’t find injections/bijections between some spaces
FLT:
FLT Proof
RSA:
That one proof about how it works and applies FLT
Polynomials
Only do this if you have time
If you get to this do a vanilla intro
Secret Sharing
Again do a vanilla intro if you get to this section

\section{General Comments}
\begin{questions}
\item Logistics
\begin{itemize}
\item Let students know that not everything will be covered during section. 
\item Also remind them to check the piazza for solutions and walkthroughs!
\end{itemize}
\item Erasure Errors
\begin{itemize}
\item This should go fairly quickly
\item THe first 4 questions (Before Exercises) are meant to be the lesson plan. Go over this together with the students
\item First exercise problem is purely algebraic (Group 2 might want to skip)
\end{itemize}



\item Secret Sharing
\begin{itemize}
\item Figure out which of the schemes to use (polynomial facts, general errors?)
\end{itemize}

\question We have a die whose 6 faces are values of consecutive integers, 
but we donâ€™t know where it starts (it is shifted over by some value 
$k$; for example, if $k = 6$, the die faces would take on the values 
$7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$). If we observe that the average of the $n$ 
samples ($n$ is large enough) is 15.5, develop a 99\% confidence 
interval for the value of $k$.

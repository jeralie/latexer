\question Find an integer x such that x is congruent to $3 mod 4$ and $5 mod 9$.
\begin{solution}[1 in]
One way is to find a number that is $1 \mod 4$ and $0 \mod 9$. \newline
To do that, we need to have $9x = 1 (\mod 4)$, which works when $x = 1$, so the number is 9. \newline
We do the same with $0 \mod 4$ and $1 \mod 9$, so $4x = 1 (\mod 9)$. This yields $x = 7$, or 28. \newline
Our answer is then $3 * 9 + 5 * 28 (\mod 36)$.
\end{solution}

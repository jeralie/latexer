\question There are on average 8 office hours in a day. The scores of an exam 
followed a normal distribution with an average of 50 and standard 
deviation of 6. If a student waits until an office hour starts, what 
is the expected value of the sum of the time they wait in hours and 
their score on the exam?

\begin{solution}[0.5cm]
\E(waiting time) = \E(exp(lambda=8/24)) = 3 \\
\E(score) = \E(normal(50, 36)) = 50 \\
By linearity of expectation, the sum is 53.
\end{solution}

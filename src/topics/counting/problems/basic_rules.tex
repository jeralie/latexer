\textbf{Rules of counting:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If your event is composed of different independent events then you can multiply together the probabilities of the independent events. 
\item
If order does not matter then count with order and then divide by the number of orderings/sorted objects 
\end{enumerate} \\
